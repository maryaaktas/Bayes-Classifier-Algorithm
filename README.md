# Bayes-Classifier-Algorithm
In this project written in Matlab, we have a little user interface for choosing the actions on 'Breast Cancer Coimbra' dataset. This data set is chosen from **https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php**. The user can display the data set itself or the centered data matrix. The user can retrieve the descriptive statistic and their interpretations. The user can add a new sample that the class of this sample is unknown and predict the category of this sample using **Bayes Classifier Algorithm**.
More details about this project can be found in **'MARYAAKTAS-BAYESCLASSIFIER.PDF'** and the 'Breast Cancer Coimbra' data set can be found in **'BreastCancerCoimbra.csv'**.
